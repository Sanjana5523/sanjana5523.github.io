              Pizza is beloved dish that originated in Italy and has become a global favorite. It typically consists of a round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough, topped with tomatoes, cheese, and various other ingredients such as meats, vegetables, and condiments. The pizza is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven, to achieve a crispy crust and melted toppings.
